# vibecommit README

VibeCommit automatically commits files whenever you save them. Use the `Toggle VibeCommit` command to turn auto-commits on or off. When enabled, each save runs `git add` and `git commit` with an autogenerated message.

## Features

* Toggle auto-commit mode with the `vibecommit.toggle` command.
* Status bar indicator shows whether auto-commit is enabled.
* Commit message prefix and timestamp are configurable.
* Optional LLM powered commit messages when `vibecommit.useLLM` is enabled.
* Logs actions to the **VibeCommit** output channel for troubleshooting.

## Requirements

If you have any requirements or dependencies, add a section describing those and how to install and configure them.

## Extension Settings

This extension contributes the following settings:

* `vibecommit.useLLM` - When true, attempt to generate commit messages via an LLM.
* `vibecommit.messagePrefix` - Prefix for autogenerated commit messages.
* `vibecommit.includeTimestamp` - Include an ISO timestamp in commit messages (default `true`).

## Known Issues

* LLM commit messages require the GitHub Copilot extension with chat access.
* The extension assumes Git is available on your PATH and the opened folder is a Git repository.

## Release Notes

### 0.0.1

Initial release with basic auto-commit functionality and configuration options.
